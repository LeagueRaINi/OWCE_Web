<h2>OWCE FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why do I need to jump through hoops to get the app?</h3>
OWCE is currently still in beta. Until we feel it is stable enough and is feature rich enough to be considered a 1.0 release that is where it will remain.

<h3>Why does TestFlight have a countdown of days remaining?</h3>
The app needs to be updated every 90 days. We try to get new features in and released in that window. If we don't manage to get that done the time will lapse and the app will no longer be available. If this happens the best way to reach out to us as mentioned below.
