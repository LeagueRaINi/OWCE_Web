    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>
        What are all these numbers?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The numbers down the top of each table is the board hardware, often abbreviated to hw. This is the physical chip inside the board.
    </p>
    <p>
        The numbers at the side of each table is the board firmware, often abbreviated as fw. This is the software that runs on the board itself.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Why can't I update to the latest firmware on my older board?
    </h3>
    <p>
        🤷‍♂️. FM decides what boards can run what firmware.
    </p>


    <h3>
        What does confirmed, private and suspected mean?
    </h3>
    <p>
        These are the different states of availability.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Confirmed</b> - Firmware is/was available for you to download in the app and update your board.</li>
            <li><b>Private</b> - Firmware is not and never was available to update via the app. The only way to get this firmware is to get your board directly from Future Motion or to have your board go in for repair and maybe it comes back with this firmware.</li>
            <li><b>Suspected</b> - Firmware has not been seen in the wild, but there should be no reason there are boards out there with this firmware.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>
        I don't want to update my firmware, not updating my app will protect me from that right?
    </h3>
    <p>
        No. But you can read more about that <a href="faq/unofficial_app_update">here</a>.
